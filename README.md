### Background

This repo, based on [reddog-code](https://github.com/Azure/reddog-code), is a deep-dive on end-to-end cloud-native modernization and transformation on Azure. Using a retail scenario that depicts a typical event-driven microservices architecture, this codebase (and associated workshop) will ease the migration and modernization of workloads targeted for Azure. This repo also highlights usage of our emergent services such as [Az Cognitive Services](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/cognitive-services/#overview), [OpenAI](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/cognitive-services/openai-service/), and [HuggingFace](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/solutions/hugging-face-on-azure/#overview) to transform enterprise applications with Azure AI offerings. In addition, with code, it shows usage of our offerings in preview such as the latest [JFR for Application Insights](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/app/java-standalone-profiler) that uses Machine Learning for insightful performance diagnostics, [passwordless connections](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/common/multiple-identity-scenarios?toc=%2Fazure%2Fdeveloper%2Fintro%2Ftoc.json&bc=%2Fazure%2Fdeveloper%2Fintro%2Fbreadcrumb%2Ftoc.json&tabs=java) to services using [managed identities](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/managed-identities-azure-resources/overview), and [JMS 2.0 API](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/service-bus-messaging/how-to-use-java-message-service-20) with Azure Service Bus.
