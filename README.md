### :warning: :construction: Java version of [reddog-code](https://github.com/Azure/reddog-code) for [Azure Spring Apps (ASA)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/spring-apps/) and [App Service](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/app-service/) is WIP

### Background

This repo, based on [reddog-code](https://github.com/Azure/reddog-code), is intended for Java, specifically Spring, developers to understand Azure hosting options and idiomatic java sdks that integrate with managed backing services. Using a retail scenario that depicts a typical event-driven microservices architecture, this codebase (and associated lab) will ease the migration and modernization of Java workloads on Azure.
